As the set of dark-matter domain specific languages has grown, it has become obvious that having a set of principles or concepts that can be referred to across many modelling specifications would prove useful. The concinnity project allows for the capture of these principles and concepts in a very flexible, non-technology specific way i.e. we don't worry about the implementation details of dark-matter objects or Google Protocol Buffer messages etc. We simply want to capture the descriptions of the basic concepts so that we can refer to them from different grammars and be able to see the relationships between different representations of the same concepts in different places.
