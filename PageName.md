# Introduction #

In larger organizations or communities that have developed software independent of one another, one of the biggest challenges is finding common ground when integration across systems is undertaken. Without a common knowledge base, there is often miscommunication and confusion. Although documents can help in diffusing knowledge, documents related to software often become irrelevant very quickly as the code evolves and no one bothers to update the documentation.

The dark-matter projects have grown over time to include several different domain specific modelling mechanisms that, in the end, have relationships between them, but result in very different artifacts being created. As new modelling mechanisms are added, it becomes onerous to try and tie them together. By introducing a higher level set of concept specifications to which all dark-matter grammars may refer, we achieve loose implementation coupling across the projects, but strong conceptual mapping across the various representations of data/behaviour specifications.

Concinnity is meant to be very flexible and easy to use and includes just a few basic concepts that allow development communities to create small, well defined units of knowledge that can then be referred to in different contexts, thus tying them together. By using this in conjunction with the dark-matter documentation generation mechanisms, you can begin to build a better understanding of how all the various components of your software relate to one another.
